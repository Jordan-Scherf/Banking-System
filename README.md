# Banking-System
This Program is essentially a banking system that has all of its information stored in a custom-made hashmap. Information is stored in an object that has the name "bankType" It stores their First and Last name, balance, pin, etc. 
Hashmaps work so fast due to their "hashing algorithm". I made this custom hashmap for a class assignment so I decided to reuse it here. 
Before running the program, take a look at the data.csv file and pick out an account to look up and mess with. NOTICE: This hashmap is extremely crude but for the most part works. If there are any issues/bugs leave a comment below.
